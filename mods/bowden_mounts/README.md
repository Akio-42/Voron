## Description
### Vertical bowden mount
I have my spools on a shelve above the printer. So i wanted the reverse bowden tube to face upwards, not sideways. The pneumatic coupler holds the bowden tube in place and allows for easy removal. It can be screwed right into the plastic part.
### Zip tie bowden mount
I have braided my reverse bowden for nicer looks. To guide it securely to the rear entry point into the housing, I changed the standard bowden tube holder a bit, so the bowden tube can be secured by a zip tie instead of having to push it through the holder.
