Nothing extra compared to the normal build. Just print the file.
## Description
With the normal dragon front printhead design of the afterburner a lot of the airflow is not used to cool the heat break. It has the possibility to flow on the left and right side without touching the heat sink. <br/>
With this mod I wanted to restrict the airflow in a way that most of the air has to pass the heat sink, hence cooling the heatsink more. <br/>
I also wanted to keep the additional weight down as much as possible.
