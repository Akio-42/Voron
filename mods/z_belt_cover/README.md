## Improvement
Added the possibility to route cables on the bottom of the cover
## Description
I liked the design of the old Voron 2.2 covers more than the current design so I based my mod on them.
To be able to achieve a clutter-free look of my 2.4 i hid cables in the extrusions as much as possible.
So i also wanted to have a hidden way to route the cables to the bottom compartment. To achieve that i made
the z belt cover a bit thicker and cut a path on the bottom where cables can be routed without being seen.
